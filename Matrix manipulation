Load variables named cost, price and sales from file business.mat.
Variable sales contains quarterly sales for two products.
Compute:
What is the yearly total sales for each product (in units sold)? (2x1 vector)
If cost is the price we pay for the product and price is the price we sell the product, what is the yearly profit for each product? (2x1 vector)
What is the total profit each quarter? (1x4 vector)
Hint: You can do this exercise using loops, but using unitwise operations and the sum() function, you can do it much quicker.

%% Solution:

function [yearlySales,productProfit,quarterlyProfit] = e4p1()

load('business.mat','cost','price','sales');
yearlySales = sum(sales,2);
profitPerUnit = price - cost;
productProfit = profitPerUnit.*yearlySales;
quarterlyProfit = sum(sales.*profitPerUnit);
