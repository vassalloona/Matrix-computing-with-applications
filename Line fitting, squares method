Attached file "T.mat" contains temperature data from Lappeenranta Airport.
Fitting a linear model (straight line, 1st degree model, 1st degree polynome) to the data, interprete the coefficients.
Is the temperature increasing? If yes, return "true" in value "trend", otherwise return "false".
Using the fit line, what would be the "predicted" temperature on New Year's Eve (December 31st, 2022)?
Hint: If you select your time axis as "day number of the year", what would be the "zeroth" day?

%% Solution:

function [newyeareve,trend] = e4p3()

y = T;
b = X\y;
newyeareve=b(1); % Constant for f(t) = value at t = 0

    disp('Temperature is increasing')
